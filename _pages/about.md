‚öôÔ∏è I'm a first year engineering student at McMaster University in Canada, interested in pursuing mechatronics/mechanical engineering

üöó I'm a part of McMaster Formula Electric on the Powertrain-Accumulator subteam.

üìö I'm interested in robotics, electromechanical systems, automotive technology, and autonomous systems.

# University Experience

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Formula Electric

As a current member of MAC Formula Electric, I've gained experience in ... 

## ü§ñ SumoBot (In Progress)

Looking to compete in mid-January 2024 at McMaster University, I and a team of three others are working on designing an autonomous combat robot to compete in a sumo-style competition against other teams.

# Projects

## üß™ Toronto Science Fair 2023 - Silver Medalist

In recognition of Discovery project titled "Testing the Aerodynamics of Small Vehicles" at the Toronto Science Fair held at the University of Toronto, my partner and I won silver. Utilizing CAD, 3D printing, computational fluid dynamics analysis, and graphical softwares, models were built, tested, and analyzed. 

Small scale models of low-poly cars at varying dimensions were designed using CAD and 3D printed in order to analyse and test their aerodynamics and efficiency. LoggerPro was used to graphically analyze and plot the cars' speeds when recorded travelling identical paths. SimScale was used to complete a CFD analysis of each car under identical conditions to retrieve their drag coefficients, and visualize wind flow in a simulated wind tunnel.

## üíª Learning Portfolio

I've set up an in-depth learning portfolio on Notion documenting my completed projects during my first year.

# High School & Leadership Experience

## üîß FIRST Robotics: Wolverine Robotics Team 5596

I was a member of a Scarborough-based community FRC team as a mechanical team member. In the 2023 season, Team 5596 won gold in two district events, qualifying and competing in provincials. 

## üîß Libermann Robotics

Competing in VEX and Skills Ontario competitions, I gained experience in my high school's robotics club over four years, and was one of two senior excecutives leading the team in my senior year. I worked on designing, prototyping, and testing mechanical designs for intake and claw mechanisms, as well as explored the fundamentals of wiring and programming the robot, As well as led initiatives to fundraise money for the club.

## üçé Young Spiritans

I'm the co-founder and served as co-president of two years of my high school's largest extra curricual club. Dedicated to student leadership, advocacy and charity, I've led a club of over 50 students in donating hundreds of canned goods multiple times per year, winter necessities to homeless shelters in downtown Toronto, and led school-wide initiatives to raise awareness for anti-child sex trafficking among other social issues.

## ‚öñÔ∏è Debate Society

I served as co-president of my school's debate society in my senior year. I have experience co-ordinating and facilitating meetings bi-weekly, planning subject material for mock debates, and leading the competetive debate team consisting of 8 competitors, and 6 volunteers in our first competition after COVID.

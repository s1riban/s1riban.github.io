# University Experience

## ⚡️ Formula Electric

I am currently a part of the Powertrain team, on the accumulator sub-team as a mechanical member. 
So far, I've researched variety critical fasteners to be implemented in the enclosure, researched and selected optimal battery vent valves, assisted in researching HV isolation and powder coating for insulation, and aided in creation of carbon fiber test panels.

I look forward to increasing my knowledge of electric vehicles and batteries, acquiring further research and CAD skills, and developing ability to work collaboratively and communicate effectively.



# High School & Leadership Experience

## 🔧 FIRST Robotics: Wolverine Robotics Team 5596

I was a member of a Scarborough-based community FRC team as a mechanical team member. In the 2023 season, Team 5596 won gold in two district events, qualifying and competing in provincials. 

## 🔧 Libermann Robotics

Competing in VEX and Skills Ontario competitions, I gained experience in my high school's robotics club over four years, and was one of two senior excecutives leading the team in my senior year. I worked on designing, prototyping, and testing mechanical designs for intake and claw mechanisms, as well as explored the fundamentals of wiring and programming the robot, As well as led initiatives to fundraise money for the club.

## 🍎 Young Spiritans

I'm the co-founder and served as co-president of two years of my high school's largest extra curricual club. Dedicated to student leadership, advocacy and charity, I've led a club of over 50 students in making an impact across the city of Toronto. This was achieved by donating hundreds of canned goods multiple times per year, winter necessities to homeless shelters in downtown Toronto, and leading school-wide initiatives to raise awareness for anti-child sex trafficking among other social issues. I helped to manage social media promotion and promote student involvement, growing the club from 2 initial members to over 50 in my final year.

## ⚖️ Debate Society

I served as co-president of my school's debate society in my senior year. I have experience co-ordinating and facilitating meetings bi-weekly, planning subject material for mock debates, and leading the competetive debate team consisting of 8 competitors, and 6 volunteers in our first competition after COVID.
